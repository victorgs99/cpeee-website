# cpeee-website
Web site that serves as a catalog of school projects.

## Summary
The goal of this project was to make a website with html, css and javascript. The website stores **evidence of school projects** done by users.

The evidences contain a title, description and a main image. In addition, they can include images, videos, audios and external links.


### Features
- **User control.** New users can register and log in to the website.
- **Evidence visualization.** Users can view their own and other users' evidence.
- **User panel.** Users can perform the following operations on their evidence: create, edit, show/hide and delete.
- **Statistics visualization.** The administrator user can see how many users have registered on the website and how many posts in total have been uploaded.

**Incomplete functionalities:** Comment on posts, leave an “I find it interesting” to highlight a particular piece of evidence and search for evidence with the search bar.

The XAMPP tool was used for the development of this project.
